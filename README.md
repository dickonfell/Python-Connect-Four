# Python-Connect-Four
A piece of work I completed for my 'Programming with Python' module in 2nd year at university. The module was intended to teach the basics of
programming with python (wow), and this work was the final project of the semester. It uses a collection of functions, described within the 
code, to run a game of connect four with a visible board, 2 levels of computer opponents and the ability to save and load the game. In the end
the harder computer opponent wasn't working as intended but I decided it was good enough, and left it at that. This was my first real
programming project so I'm sure it has plenty of flaws but I am pretty happy with how it turned out.
